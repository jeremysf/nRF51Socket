# nRF51Socket
QFN48 socket to J-Link/JTAG 20-pin connector to program bootloaders, etc for Nordic nRF51.

I included a USB connector as an alternative to using the 5V power from the J-Link, but haven't had to use that yet, the power from the J-Link device works great!

I also included a 16mhz crystal in the design so that I could boot up the nRF51 and do some basic validation. Probably could get away without populating those or related components.

The socket is available on Amazon.com and Ebay.com for about $100 it's a QFN-48(52)BT-0.4-01 manufactured by Enplas.
